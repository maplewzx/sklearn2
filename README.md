# sklearn2

Sklearn 2 is a small extension of sklearn. It is developped with the same conventions as sklearn in order to be mergeable with sklearn eventually.

It is in development phase : it will change radically, often and without notice.

## Requirements

Anaconda Python

## Installation

    >pip install sklearn2
